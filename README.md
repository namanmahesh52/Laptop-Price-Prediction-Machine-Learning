# Laptop-Price-Prediction-Machine-Learning
The aim of the "Laptop Price Prediction" Machine Learning project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of laptops based on various features such as specifications, brand, and other relevant factors.


 # 1. Data Collection:
   - The dataset used for this project was obtained from other sources. It consists of various features of laptops such as processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, brand, screen size, 
      etc., along with their corresponding prices.
   
 # 2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling were performed to prepare the dataset for model training.
    
 # 3. Feature Engineering:
   - Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information from the dataset and create new features that might improve the model's performance.
   
 # 4. Model Selection and Training:
   - Several machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc., were experimented with to find the best performing model.
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the models' performance.
   
 # 5. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared were used to assess the performance of the trained models.
   
 # 6. Deployment:
   - The best performing model was deployed using different libraries to create a simple web application or API where users can input the specifications of a laptop and get the predicted price.
   
 # 7. Results:
   - The final model achieved [accuracy/precision/recall] of [value] on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in predicting laptop prices.
   
 # 8. Future Improvements:
   - Suggestions for future improvements may include collecting more diverse data, exploring advanced machine learning techniques, and enhancing the user interface of the deployed application.
   
 # 9. Dependencies:
   - List of dependencies and libraries used in the project (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc.).
